    "Bayesian inference bridges the gap between white-box model introspection and black-box predictive performance. We gain the ability to fully specify a model and fit it to observed data according to our prior knowledge. Small datasets are handled well and the overall method and results are very intuitive: lending to both statistical insight and future prediction.\n",

    "\n",
    "PyMC3 is an iteration upon the prior PyMC2, and comprises a comprehensive package of symbolic statistical modelling syntax and very efficient gradient-based samplers using the Theano library (of deep-learning fame) for gradient computation. Of particular interest is that it includes the Non U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) developed recently by Hoffman & Gelman in 2014, which is only otherwise available in STAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "PySTAN is a wrapper around STAN, a major3 open-source framework for Bayesian inference developed by Gelman, Carpenter, Hoffman and many others. STAN also has HMC and NUTS samplers, and recently, Variational Inference - which is a very efficient way to approximate the joint probability distribution. Models are specified in a custom syntax and compiled to C++."

The raw dataset is available for [direct download](http://carfueldata.direct.gov.uk/downloads/download.aspx?rg=aug2015) and is small but varied enough for our use here: roughly 2500 cars and 10 features inc hierarchies of car parent-manufacturer > manufacturer > model.\n",
